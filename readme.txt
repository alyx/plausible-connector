== Description ==

== Installation ==

After installing this plugin, make sure to visit the Settings -> Plausible page
to customize your settings.

At minimum, you will net to set the _Plausible Domain ID_ value. If you have
configured any other customization with your Plausible script (e.g., using your

and _Plausible Tracker_ values at their default.
